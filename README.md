# üéæ St Johns Park Tennis Court Monitor

**Goal:** Automatically monitor tennis court availability at St Johns Park (Tower Hamlets) and send email notifications when evening courts (after 5pm) become available.

## What This Script Does

- **Monitors:** St Johns Park tennis courts every 30 minutes (6 AM - 1 AM UK time)
- **Checks:** All available time slots across 7 days in advance
- **Filters:** Only notifies for courts available after 5pm
- **Smart Notifications:** Only sends emails for genuinely new slots (prevents spam)
- **Runs:** Automatically on GitHub Actions (free, no computer needed)

## Email Notifications

The email is designed to be easy to scan at a glance:

- Header: shows the check time (UTC)
- New Evening Slots (after 5pm): grouped by day cards labeled with `YYYY-MM-DD (Weekday)` and a count badge; each slot appears as a compact pill like `18:00 ‚Ä¢ Court 2`
- All Evening Slots (after 5pm): also grouped by day with a total count and a ‚Äúnew‚Äù count; newly found slots are highlighted
- All Available Slots: grouped by day for the entire day (not just evenings); clean pill layout

Notes:
- Days are labelled with the weekday (e.g., `2025-09-16 (Tuesday)`).
- The previous summary box has been removed to keep the focus on the grouped sections.
